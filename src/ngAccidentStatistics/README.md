To debug within tests, simply place *console.log* statements or *debugger* where you want to debug and chrome has all sorts of watches to evaluate and step through the problem.

Viewing the debug output can be seen within the terminal window, as well as the same information from the chrome browser, which means you could essentially run in headless mode to speed up the tests and see teh results within the terminal.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). Make sure the Owin Api is running in the background so the test can access the data.
